    <p>
        Your school is the institution you owe so much to. As a child you enter into school in kindergarten, and it is your teacher who teaches you the alphabets and the numbers in class. Year after year as you grow up and complete class after class you keep on learning, assimilating knowledge and developing a well-rounded personality. You also become more and more capable and equipped to do your duties and responsibilities as a good citizen and fine human being. Your teachers at school teach you with a great deal of care and concern and patience. When you are through with school, you are grateful to your school and all the teachers who shaped and moulded you into what you become. And you always carry fond memories of your alma mater. You will find here below a number of short and long paragraphs on My School of varying word lengths. We hope these My School paragraphs will help students in completing their school assignments. These will also help children to write and read out paragraphs in 
        simple words and with small sentences. Students can select any paragraph on My School according to their particular requirement.</p>
    <h1 style="text-align: center; font-family: 'Brush Script MT'"> Mission</h1>
    <p>
        The New School prepares students to understand, contribute to, and succeed in a rapidly changing society, thus making the world a better and more just place. We will ensure that our students develop both the skills that a sound education provides and the competencies essential for success and leadership in the emerging creative economy. We will also lead in generating practical and theoretical knowledge that enables people to better understand our world and improve conditions for local and global communities.</p>
    <h1 style="text-align: center; font-family: 'Brush Script MT'"> Vision</h1>
    <p>
        We are and will be a university where design and social research drive approaches to studying issues of our time, such as democracy, urbanization, technological change, economic empowerment, sustainability, migration, and globalization. We will be the preeminent intellectual and creative center for effective engagement in a world that increasingly demands better-designed objects, communication, systems, and organizations to meet social needs. Our vision aligns with shifts in the global economy, society, and environment, which animates our mission and our values: Creativity, innovation, and a desire to challenge the status quo will affect what and how we teach and the intellectual ambitions of the university itself. Social engagement should orient students&#39; academic experiences to help them become critically engaged citizens, dedicated to solving problems and contributing to the public good. The New School must embrace these principles and innovate to address shifts in the global 
        economy, society, and environment that require individuals to grapple with complex problems, pursue more fluid and flexible career pathways, and collaboratively create change.</p>
